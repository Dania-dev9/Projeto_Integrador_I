📚 UNIVERSUS — Gamified Web Quiz Application

Universus is a gamified web application inspired by the brazilian interactive quiz style of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. The goal of the project is to create a dynamic educational platform where students can answer questions, earn points, and track their progress — making learning more engaging and interactive.

🎯 Project Goal

Develop a system capable of:
- Generating an interactive quiz based on questions stored in a structured document
- Converting this document into JSON
- Transforming the JSON into a dynamically generated Google Form, using the Google Forms API as a reference
- Providing a functional, scalable, and easily integrable API

🛠️ Development Stages
✔ 1. Planning & Documentation

During the first phase of the project, we completed:
- Initial documentation structure
- Definition of functional and non-functional requirements
- Modeling of the quiz flow
- Analysis of the Google Forms API for reference

✔ 2. Proof of Concept (PoC)

We validated the main idea by confirming:
- The possibility of converting documents into JSON
- The feasibility of dynamically generating forms
- Basic implementation of the quiz flow

✔ 3. MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

We built a working prototype containing:
- Basic API that receives data
- Initial document → JSON conversion
- Partial form generation
- Simple interface for internal testing

✔ 4. API Development (Current Stage)

We are currently implementing:

📄 Automatic transformation of document → JSON
📝 JSON → Google Form conversion
🔗 Integration with external endpoints
🧩 Architecture improvements, organization, and code versioning

🚀 Main Features

- Gamified quiz inspired by Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
